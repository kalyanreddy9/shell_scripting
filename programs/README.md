# shell_scripting

- **program1.sh** - Demonstrates basic shell scripting concepts such as variable declaration, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, command substitution, readonly and unset variables, quoting, and escaping special characters with practical examples.
- **program2.sh** - Shows different ways to handle user input using the `read` command with various options including basic input, password input with -s, timed input with -t, and raw input with -r. 
- **program_3.sh** - demonstrates Bash conditional statements using if/elif/else and pattern matching with case to print messages based on a number value and fruit type
- **program_4.sh** - demonstrates three primary Bash loops: a for loop for fixed iterations, a while loop for executing commands while a condition is true, and an until loop that runs until a condition becomes true
- **program_5.sh** - Demonstrates Bash functions, passing arguments, capturing output using command substitution, and using return status for success/failure checks.
- **program_6.sh** - Covers string manipulation including concatenation, substring extraction, and search/replace with parameter expansion.
