# shell_scripting

- **program1.sh** - Demonstrates basic shell scripting concepts such as variable declaration, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, command substitution, readonly and unset variables, quoting, and escaping special characters with practical examples.
- **program2.sh** - Shows different ways to handle user input using the `read` command with various options including basic input, password input with -s, timed input with -t, and raw input with -r. 
- **program_3.sh** - demonstrates Bash conditional statements using if/elif/else and pattern matching with case to print messages based on a number value and fruit type
- **program_4.sh** - demonstrates three primary Bash loops: a for loop for fixed iterations, a while loop for executing commands while a condition is true, and an until loop that runs until a condition becomes true
- **program_5.sh** - Demonstrates Bash functions, passing arguments, capturing output using command substitution, and using return status for success/failure checks.
- **program_6.sh** - Covers string manipulation including concatenation, substring extraction, and search/replace with parameter expansion.
- **program_7.sh** - Introduces arrays: declaration, indexing, looping, and basic manipulation such as adding, updating, and removing elements.
- **program_8.sh** → Demonstrates handling command-line arguments (`$0`, `$1`, `$@`, `$*`, `$#`) in shell scripts.  
- **program_9.sh** → Shows error handling with exit codes, custom error messages, and using `trap` with cleanup on `Ctrl+C`.  
- **program_10.sh** – Demonstrates text processing commands like `grep` for searching patterns and `sed` for text substitution, deletion, and line insertion with examples.  
- **program_11.sh** – TODO- Introduces regular expressions (regex) in shell scripting and shows how tools like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` use them for advanced text matching and transformations.  
- **program_12.sh** – Explains pipelines and redirection using operators like `|`, `<`, `>`, and `>>` to control input/output between commands and files.  
- **program_13.sh** – Covers shell script debugging with `set -x` for tracing execution and `set -e` for stopping scripts on errors, along with examples and output.  
- **program_14.sh** – TODO-Explains subshells and process control with examples of running commands in isolated environments using parentheses `()` and temporary variable scopes.
